High Altitude Balloon Telemetry
===============================

This program is apart of the KD8ZRC (Northeast Ohio Experimenters Club) high altitude balloon telemetry. We use this program to produce RTTY audio that we then feed to a FM radio. 

Current functionality:

* PWM RTTY Audio Output 
* GPS NEMA parsing

Planned:

* ADC readings (for temp/battery telemetry)
* I2C (TWI) communications (for sensors)
* SPI communications (for sensors)
* Serial communications 

To Do:

* Organize code better (more than one file).
* Add 16 bit CRC.
* Variable stop bit length.
* Organize project better (git branching).
* Write more on this README about how to do things etc.
* Demo video?
* Frama

High Altitude Balloon RTTY Telemetry.

This is a seperate place for the rtty telemetry code. I need to clean it up.
